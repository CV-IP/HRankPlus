# An extension version of our CVPR 2020, oral: HRank: Filter Pruning using High-Rank Feature Map ([Link](https://128.84.21.199/abs/2002.10179)).

### We are now releasing this code under the request of many friends. However, we are not sure if this code is stable. Please contact us if you have found any problem, which would be appreciated.

### In the next two or three months, we will continue to maintain this repository and the pruned models will be released constantly.
